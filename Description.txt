# 🌸 PETAL MEADOW - HOW TO PLAY

## 🍓 OBJECTIVE
Welcome to Petal Meadow - a beautiful flower field full of adorable birds!

Your mission is to capture the wild birds and return them to their correct nests according to color before time runs out.

## 🕹️ CONTROLS
- Use the on-screen joystick to move your strawberry.
- Approach wild birds to begin the taming process.
- Swipe smoothly to guide your flock of birds.

## 🐦 TAMING BIRDS
- Keep the bird within the bright circle around the strawberry.
- Wait for the white loading bar to fill (approximately 2 seconds).

- When tamed successfully, the bird will display a happy heart/star icon.
- Tamed birds will have a bright white border and automatically follow you.

## 🏠 GUIDING BIRDS TO THEIR NESTS
- Blue birds must go to the Blue Nest 🔵
- Pink birds must go to the Pink Nest 🩷

- Purple birds must go to the Purple Nest 💜

- Guide the birds near the nest; they will automatically fly in.

- When they enter the correct nest: A green checkmark ✅ will appear and a cheerful sound will play!

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE
- Birds will lose their tameness if you stay too far away (about 2 seconds outside the circle).

- If you lead a bird to the wrong nest: A red ❌ mark will appear.
- Birds that enter the wrong nest can still be rescued - tame them again and lead them out.

- Pay attention to the countdown timer in the upper corner - it will flash red when there are 10 seconds left!

- Each level may have 1, 2, or all 3 different bird colors.

## 🎯 WINNING CONDITIONS

Get ALL the birds into their correct nests before time runs out!

The screen will show the number of birds that have entered/total number of birds for each color in the upper corner.

## 🎮 GAME TIPS
- Capture multiple birds at once to save time
- Prioritize birds furthest from the nest first
- Take the birds to the nearest nest first
- Always pay attention to the capture circle to avoid losing birds
- If time is running out, focus on completing the color with the fewest birds remaining
